In the subsequent lines you can read about some basics of the protocol and how you can use it in StremPipes.

##### Please Notice
This article and the corresponding work in StreamPipes were part of the seminar
*Data Science and Real Time Analytics* of the [FZI](https://www.fzi.de/en/home/) in summer term 2020. <br>
I really enjoyed the opportunity to work on a practical topic like this and contribute to this project.
